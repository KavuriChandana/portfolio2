      <h2>Muniba Mazari – Courageous and hopeful in the face of disability</h2>
      <h5>by Waqar Asghar, Aug 20, 2015</h5>

      <p style="text-align:justify">There are some people in this world who fight an unseen battle within themselves 24/7, with a big smile on their face. They never cry nor whine about the intricacies of life. They know how to keep themselves happy and away from anxiety at all times. We call such people warriors because they know the value of life and how to derive the most from it. They know how to face the difficulties of life no matter how immense they may be. These type of people are way better than those who just exist in the world, not knowing the purpose of life itself.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Muniba Mazai, a 27-year old girl is one of these people, who fights an unseen battle within herself, never losing her smile. At the age of 21, she had a car accident. She was travelling to her hometown Rahim Yar Khan from a remote area of Balochistan. Her car fell into a ditch. As a result of this atrocious accident, half of her body was crushed and the remaining half was paralyzed. This forced Muniba to use a wheel chair, which has now become a part of her life. This accident helped Muniba explore the artist in her. She is an accomplished artist now. In other words, the accident was a blessing in disguise for Muniba.</p>

<h2>Q/A with MUNIBA MAZARI</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
 <div class="card" "container">
<h4>Would you like to tell us about your accident. At what age did it happen. and how did it happen ?</h4>
<p  style="text-align:justify"> I was 20 when I had this accident. It’s been 9 years. I was traveling from Quetta to Rahim Yar Khan. Due to the driver’s negligence the car went into a ditch. This incident broke me physically but has made me a stronger person emotionally.</p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="col-sm-4">
 <div class="card">
<h4>Was it easy for you to cope up with this accident? How did you friends and family support you ?</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">Initially It was very painful physically and emotionally. Half body was fractured, half was paralysed because of the spinal chord injury. The fact that half your body stops working and you realise you’ll stay this way for the rest of your life, can make you depressed. But then I gathered myself because of my mother and brothers, that is my staunch support system. I live for them, they live for me. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-4">
 <div class="card">
<h4>The accident must also be a difficult experience as in  a country like Pakistan where there are few opportunities for people in a wheel chair. What has been your experience?</h4>
<p  style="text-align:justify">I know that practically it’s hard to live in a country where there’s no disability awareness. But let me tell you whatever I am today it’s because of this country and its people. The respect and love that I’ve received from everyone is priceless. This country is the land of opportunities for those who have the courage to face challenges head on. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
 <div class="card">
<h4>You have demonstrated a remarkable ability to convert a weakness into a strength. What really motivated you to overcome all the obstacles, both physical and psychological?</h4>
<p  style="text-align:justify"> The only thing that keeps me going is the desire to do something better for the country and for its people. I just wanted to live a purposeful life. I know I’m a very blessed human being. There are many in the world who are not as blessed as I am. So giving yourself a reminder of being grateful helps you in dealing with all kinds of negativity and depression.</p>

 <div class="card">
<h4>Tell us about your son and the relationship you enjoy with him.</h4>
<p  style="text-align:justify">The day I held Nael in my arms for the first time, I felt complete. Now he’s almost five. We are great friends. We paint together, we play, we learn new things everyday, we laugh and cry together. This little soul has given me so much strength and a beautiful reason to live. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
 <div class="card">
<h4>In a country like Pakistan  women have less opportunities and they face different kinds of pressures. What message would you like to give to not only women but to their families too?</h4>
<p  style="text-align:justify">It’s not only about opportunities. Sometimes you have to become fearless to pursue your dreams. Sometimes you have to create opportunities. It’s not your weakness that you are a woman who lives in Pakistan. Make it your strength. Show your family what you are capable of. And the people who truly love you, will always support you. </p>

<h4>Lastly, as an ambassador for UN Women you also have great responsibility. Tell us how you are helping or motivating women?</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">People ask me about women’s empowerment. I always say that no one can empower a woman but a woman herself. My responsibility is to tell not just women but men as well that in this day and age, you can’t live a happy successful life if you believe in gender discrimination. Gone are the days when women were told what to do and what not. Today we know what we want and we have taken charge of our lives and our decisions. I want both men and women to understand this simple thing that when a woman empowers herself, she empowers the whole generation. So let’s support her and tell her that she’s capable of doing everything.   </p>
